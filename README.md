# Exploratory data analysis

In this project, I carried out analysis based on three of Singapore's local universities to explore the correlation between a university's ranking, and how it has affected the employment outcome of its fresh graduates across the years 2015 to 2021. Additionally, analysis was also carried out to determine whether it is true that university rankings no longer affects the employment outcomes of its fresh graduates as much as it did in previous years.
